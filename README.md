This repo was created in order to gather the raw data for an [Unofficial 'This American Life' Tracker App.](https://github.com/Gauraklein/this_american_life_tracker) Through the development process I was able to explore some interesting technologies such as *puppeteer* and *cheerio* as well as work in depth with async functions. I was also able to explore in depth the HTML structure of the ['This American Life' website](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/) and reverse engineer the way that their website is built.
